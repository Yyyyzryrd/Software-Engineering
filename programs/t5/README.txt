task 5 - strings

smallest string is an empty placeholder, containing zero characters: ""
multiline strings can be defined using """xyz""" or '''xyz'''. this preserves its formatting

you cannot concatenate a string and a non-string, without casting it
f-string = "f{variable}", short for formatted string

-slicing:
[begin:end:step]
>Hello
[1:] = ello
[:1] = H
[1::2] = el
[4:1:-1] = oll (-1 is reverse, or from the back)

we can use .upper(), .lower(), .replace() etc
\n = new line
\t = tab
\s = space
