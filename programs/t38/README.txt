Task 38:

- (watch_next.py) using Natural Language Processing to create something akin to the "watch next" feature of Netflix
- (semantic.py) introduction to measuring how/why spacy sees certain terms as more similar or different

. spacy demonstrates similarity on a scale of 0-1, in which 0 is minimum similarity, and 1 is maximum similarity
. en_core_web_sm is an older version of spacy NLP recognition, surprisingly less accurate than en_core_web_md
. I believe NLP could be fairly useful when creating a search-engine function for a website or software, such as in a chatroom feature where you wish to find old messages. it'd be more user-friendly to use NLP to change terms into their base form
